"""Flag loaded or judgemental words in the model's own voice (a safety net behind prompt rule 9).

Briefings must report in neutral words; loaded words may appear only inside a quotation from the speaker who
used them. Flags are shown to the reader, like unsupported text: the words stay, highlighted, so nothing is
silently rewritten. Ambiguous words with common neutral senses ("claims" for benefits, "extreme weather",
"lie ahead") are deliberately not on the list, and "claimed" counts only as a verb of saying.
